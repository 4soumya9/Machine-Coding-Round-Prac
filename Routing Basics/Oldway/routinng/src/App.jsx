/*Case 1: With <Outlet />

Go to /products â†’ You see:

Hii is a Product
[Cars] [Bikes]


Click Cars â†’

Hii is a Product
[Cars] [Bikes]
This is the Car page


Click Bikes â†’

Hii is a Product
[Cars] [Bikes]
This is the Bike page


âœ… Child route UI (Car or Bike) shows inside parent.

Case 2: Without <Outlet />
{/* <Outlet /> removed */

/*Go to /products/car â†’ You see only:

Hii is a Product
[Cars] [Bikes]


Car page does not show anywhere. Same for Bike.

ðŸ‘‰ Because React Router did load the Car or Bike component, but since thereâ€™s no <Outlet />, it has no place to inject them.*/
