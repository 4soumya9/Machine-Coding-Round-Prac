. winningCombinations

This is usually an array of all possible winning index patterns in Tic-Tac-Toe:

const winningCombinations = [
  [0, 1, 2], // top row
  [3, 4, 5], // middle row
  [6, 7, 8], // bottom row
  [0, 3, 6], // left column
  [1, 4, 7], // middle column
  [2, 5, 8], // right column
  [0, 4, 8], // diagonal
  [2, 4, 6]  // diagonal
];


Each element is a triple ([a, b, c]) representing indexes of the board that form a winning line.

2. for (let combo of winningCombinations)

Loop through each possible winning pattern.

Example: first iteration → combo = [0, 1, 2].

3. const [a, b, c] = combo;

Array destructuring: assigns

a = 0, b = 1, c = 2 (for the first combo).

Makes it easier to use instead of writing combo[0], combo[1], combo[2].

4. if (board[a] && board[a] === board[b] && board[a] === board[c])

This condition checks three things:

board[a] → ensures the first cell is not empty (otherwise "empty === empty" would wrongly count as a win).

board[a] === board[b] → first cell equals the second.

board[a] === board[c] → first cell equals the third.

✅ If all three are true → it means the same player ("X" or "O") filled all three positions in a winning line.
